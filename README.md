# accesible_extension

This is an accessible Chrome Extension to enhance readability on websites for people with Dyslexia! After studying barriers people with Dyslexia face in interacting with their computers, this is an attempt to blend the features that aid in readability all in one place - as Dyslexia presents itself differently in every individual. 

Feel free to add the extension to your Chrome account by downloading and unpacking it on the Chrome Extensions page.
